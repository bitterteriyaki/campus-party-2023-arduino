# Campus Party: Connecting LEDs with Arduino

This repository contains codes to interact with LEDs using Arduino, made in an interactive lecture by [Meninas.comp](https://www.meninas.cic.unb.br) during Campus Party Bras√≠lia in 2023.

The folder `sketch_apr_08b` contains the code to turn on the LED repeatedly, while `sketch_apr_08c` contains a code that sends "Hello world" in Morse code using the LED.
